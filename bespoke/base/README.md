# Bespoke Engine for Deep Learning Workflows

This engine is a comprehensive tool for deep learning model operations such as building, training, fine-tuning, and querying. It is built on TensorFlow and Horovod for distributed training, and it features custom modules for task-specific workflows and model compression.

## Features

- Random house building for model construction.
- Transfer learning support for pre-trained models.
- Fine-tuning functionality for model refinement.
- Query support for model information retrieval.
- Approximation techniques for model compression.

## Requirements

- TensorFlow
- Horovod
- EfficientNet (for pre-built EfficientNet models)

## Usage

The engine is composed of several major functions that can be imported and used within other scripts or directly via command line arguments. Each function corresponds to a specific operation in the deep learning model lifecycle.

## Functions

- `module_load(task_path)`: Dynamically loads a Python module during runtime.
- `transfer_learning_()`: Implements transfer learning using Horovod for distributed training.
- `transfer_learning()`: Wrapper function for the transfer learning process.
- `build()`: Constructs models using random house building.
- `approximate()`: Creates approximate versions of models for compression.
- `finetune()`: Refines models through fine-tuning.
- `cut()`: Extracts non-gated models from gated ones.
- `query()`: Retrieves and saves the best-performing models based on specified metrics.

## Configuration

The engine uses YAML configuration files to set up model parameters, training settings, and other important variables.

## Customization

You can customize the engine by adding new functionalities, supporting additional model architectures, or integrating with other machine learning frameworks and libraries.

## Contributing

Contributions to the engine can include performance enhancements, new features, bug fixes, or documentation improvements.
