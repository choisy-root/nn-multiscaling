# Model Evaluation Script

This script is designed for the evaluation of TensorFlow models. It measures the performance of models in terms of various metrics, including GPU and CPU execution times, ONNX compatibility, and TFLite performance. It also validates the accuracy of the models against a given dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- tf2onnx
- onnxruntime
- keras_flops
- bespoke (a custom module as per the script)
- nncompress (a custom module as per the script)
